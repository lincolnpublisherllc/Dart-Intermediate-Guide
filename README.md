Extracted Code — Dart Intermediate Guide

This repository contains all code snippets extracted chapter by chapter from the book Dart Intermediate Guide. Each snippet is stored in its respective chapter folder, making it easier to navigate, test, and reuse.

📂 Structure

chapter_XX/ — Folder for each chapter (with two-digit numbering).

Files inside are named snippet_###.<ext>, where:

.dart → Dart source code

.yaml → Pubspec and YAML config

.json → JSON examples

.csv → CSV data

.sql → SQL examples

.sh → Shell/terminal commands

📝 Notes

Code blocks were detected heuristically, based on formatting and common Dart patterns.

If a snippet landed in the wrong file type (e.g., YAML saved as .dart), you can simply rename it.

Only code-like blocks were extracted. Explanatory prose was skipped.

Chapters without detectable code snippets don’t have a folder.

✅ Usage

Browse into the chapter folder you want to explore.

Open the code snippets in your Dart IDE, editor, or terminal.

Run Dart files with:

dart run filename.dart


Use YAML/JSON/SQL/CSV files as supporting data in your Dart projects.
